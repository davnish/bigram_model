# Bigram_model
In this notebook we will built two simple bigram model from scratch which will be able predict the next character given a character. We have a small dataset of names.
This model will allow us to predict some names based on the dataset we have given to it. Although the predictions are not great because this is a simple bigram model.

We have built two models here:
- Statistical Model
- NN Model

The Libraries Used Here are:
- `Pytorch`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
